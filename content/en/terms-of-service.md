# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By clicking around or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to these terms. Cool? Cool.

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and sweet membership services. We're talking blog articles, exclusive resources ✨, e-books, and community vibes. Just a little heads-up: some of that awesome content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** gotta provide a valid email address and pick a password to get their account set up.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and everything that happens with it. Big rule: you absolutely **cannot** transfer or share your account. Seriously, don't.
*   **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they ever break these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually. You'll always see the exact fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Big plus: we don't store your payment info here at the Site – your security is a top priority! 🔒
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** – just a heads-up! Make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with the service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up: each user only gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, then sorry, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. 💔

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** on this Site is **copyrighted by hubtoday** 🛡️. That means you can't copy, repost, or use it for commercial stuff without getting our green light first.
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content. It's strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure, cool?
*   **If you're thinking about commercial use or extensive citation**, please make sure to contact the Site first to get our authorization. Thanks for respecting our work! 🙏

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **It's strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it positive, folks! 👍
*   **It's absolutely not allowed** to bulk download, scrape, or try to crack our member-exclusive content using any technical tricks. Play fair! 🚫
*   **The Site** has every right to remove any inappropriate content and will definitely **ban users** who violate these rules. No messing around here!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. Just so you know! 🤷‍♀️
*   **The Site** will **not be liable for compensation** if our content temporarily becomes inaccessible due to things like acts of God (force majeure), server hiccups, or issues with third-party services. Sometimes things are just out of our hands! ☁️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information we provide on the Site** is strictly for reference only. It **does not constitute** any professional advice – seriously, we're not your financial, legal, or medical gurus! 🙅‍♂️
*   **The Site** will **not be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just a heads-up on that!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are gonna be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸. We're totally skipping any conflict of law principles here.
*   **Any disputes** popping up from or related to these terms? First off, let's try to sort it out amicably between us, no drama! 🤝 If we can't hug it out, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California, which have jurisdiction.
