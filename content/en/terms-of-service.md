# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday**, referred to as "this site" or "we." Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of this site means you're cool with and accept these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
This site offers users premium subscription content and awesome member perks. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **User Accounts:** To get started, you'll need a valid email address and to set up a password to register for an account.
*   **Account Responsibility:** You're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for everything that happens under your login. Seriously, don't share or transfer your account—it's a big no-no. 🚫
*   **Account Suspension/Termination:** If you play fast and loose with these terms, we reserve the right to hit pause or even terminate your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription Details:** Our subscription services are charged on a monthly or yearly basis, and the fees are always upfront on the checkout page.
*   **Payment Processing:** We handle all payments through trusted third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal), so relax—we don't store any of your payment deets.
*   **Auto-Renewal:** Your subscription will auto-renew, so if you wanna bail, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **14-Day Money-Back Guarantee!** 🤑 If you're a first-timer and our service isn't quite hitting the spot, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just ping us at the email below with your refund reason. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, all payments are final unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **Copyright:** Heads up: All the awesome original content here is © copyrighted by hubtoday. No copying, reposting, or commercial use without getting our thumbs-up first, okay?
*   **User Access Rights:** You get a non-exclusive, non-transferable pass to dive in for your personal learning and reading—nothing more.
*   **Authorization for Commercial Use:** Got bigger plans, like commercial use or quoting a bunch? Just hit us up for permission.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Prohibited Content:** Basically, don't upload, post, or spread anything sketchy—illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or content that messes with someone else's rights. No bueno. 🚫
*   **Technical Abuse:** And definitely no mass downloading, scraping, or trying to crack our member content with tech wizardry. That's a straight-up no-go. 🙅‍♀️
*   **Enforcement:** We'll yank any inappropriate content and might just give violating users the boot. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **Right to Modify:** We can tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes. 🍪
*   **No Liability for Interruptions:** If something goes haywire—like a server crash, an act of nature, or a third-party service hiccup—and content is temporarily MIA, we can't be held responsible for any losses. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **Informational Purposes Only:** Just a friendly reminder: The info here is for reference only and isn't professional advice (like for finance, law, or health). Always check with a pro for that stuff! 🧠
*   **No Liability for Losses:** And we're not on the hook for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just a heads up!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **Applicable Law:** These Terms of Service play by the rules of California, USA, without fussing over conflict of law principles.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** If any beef arises from these terms, we'll try to sort it out friendly-style first. If we can't, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal? 🤝
